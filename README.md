# ABCD-normalization


## Overview

Data from multisite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies contain variance attributable to the scanner that can reduce statistical power and potentially bias results if not appropriately managed. ABCD Study is a prospective longitudinal study starting at the ages of 9-10 and following participants for 10 years. These scans are acquired on 29 different scanners of 5 different model types manufactured by 3 different vendors (request access at: https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/).

The ABCD study is a collection of neuroimaging, neurocognitive, genetic, physiological, psychosocial, and other behavioral data from ~12,000 sociodemographically diverse youth recruited from 9-10 years of age, from across the USA, to investigate the host of factors that may affect adolescent health. The provision of these data alongside comprehensive demographic and behavioral measures make for a low “cost of entry” for any researcher to conduct statistical analyses on the ABCD cohort or any sub-population therein. However, such investigators must be cognizant of the potentially confounding effects of different scanners on the neuroimaging measures. As a commitment to open and reproducible science, data from the ABCD Study is publicly available for users to access, further highlighting the importance of addressing the responsible use of these data, as well as the perpetuation and reproduction of narratives and practices that impact historically minoritized populations as a result of their misuse. 



To that end, we have created this simple-to-use tool to enable investigators to "harmonize" the data - that is: to remove scanner induced variance present in the data while preserving the biological variability in the sample.
